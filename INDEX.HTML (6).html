               <li><b><A name ="2">Software Piracy :</A></b>Software Piracy refers to the theft of software through illegal copying of genuine programs or counterfeiting and circulation of products which are duplicate copies of the original.</li>

               <li><b><A name ="3">Plagiarism</A></b>Plagiarising means using or imitating the language and thoughts of some other person and projecting that representation as to your original work.</li><br> <br>
               The Merriam-Webster Dictionary explains "plagiarise" as: <br><br>
               
           <ul type="disc">

                   <Li><b>Direct Plagiarism:</b> This type of plagiarism occurs when the user copies the work of another person, word to word without acknowledging the original author or quoting the text.</Li> <br>
                   
                   <li><b>Self-Plagiarism:</b> It is the type of plagiarism where the author uses his original manuscript in more than one contex without citing that it was used earlier as well. The reader is made to believe that the text is unique in every context that it is being used in. Even though this act is not illegal, it is not ethical either.</li><br>
               
                   <li><b>Mosaic Plagiarism: </b>This type of plagiarism happens when the same sentence structure is used with synonyms for the appropriate words of the sentence.</li><br>

         <ul type ="disc">
               
             <li>All sources are not accurate, nor do they validate the information as accurate. Therefore, one must specify the source, which informs the reader about the basis of one's ideas and the extent of one's research.</li><br>
             <li>To avoid plagiarism, one should refer to several sources, understand the concept, and then pen down one's understanding of the topic.</li><br>
            <li> Use quotation marks around all the quoted words to avoid plagiarism.</li><br>
            <li> In the education sector, students should be encouraged to present their original and innovative ideas. Even if they wish to refer to the resources, they should be made aware of the methods of citation. In this manner, plagiarism can be avoided, and students can be motivated to work hard.</li><br>
