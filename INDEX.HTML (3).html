         <li> <b><A name="1"> Stick to the rules of conduct online that you follow in real life : </A></b>
         When communicating online, remember the rules of etiquette that you follow in your everyday life. Refrain from insulting, provoking, threatening or insulting others. Respect the opinions of your chat counterparts and express constructive criticism. Remember that you can be prosecuted for insulting people online.</li><br><br>

         <li> <b><A name="2">Netiquette Think of the person : </A></b> 
         Think of the person behind the computer when you compose your messages. You are not communicating with a machine, but with real people. Also, consider what and how you write. Because the internet doesn't forget anything! A screenshot or a copy of your messages is quickly made and still exists even if you delete your messages afterward.</li><br><br>

         <li><b><A name="3"> Present your best side online :</A> </b>
         Communication on the internet comes with a certain anonymity that does not exist in real life when you are talking to someone face to face. Often this anonymity leads to a lower inhibition threshold for many users and they behave rudely online if, for example, you disagree with them.

         Make sure that you show your best side online. Remain friendly and respectful, even if you disagree. Good netiquette is characterized by respect, politeness and professionalism.</li><br><br>

         <li> <b><A name="4">Read first, then ask
         Do you have a question about something? Then take the time to carefully read the answers in the previous discussion posts first:</A></b>
         There is a good chance that someone has already answered your question. If you write an answer similar to someone else's, it shows the other chat participants that you have paid little attention to the conversation so far.

         Remember that conversations online can happen very quickly. It is therefore important to gather all the information before responding or asking questions.</li><br><br>

         <li><b> <A name="5"> Netiquette: Pay attention to grammar and punctuation
         Take time to read through your answers again:</A></b>
             
         Check them for grammar, punctuation and correct spelling. It can be very frustrating for the other person if they have to decipher poorly written sentences in order grasp the meaning behind them. In addition, faulty grammar distracts from the goal of your message.

         Grammar, spelling and punctuation become especially important when composing emails or other correspondence that you submit to colleagues or superiors. If you have a weakness in grammar and spelling, don't be discouraged. Use spelling aids before you send messages.</li><br><br>

         <li> <b><A name="6"> Respect the privacy of others :</A></b>
         This rule should be followed not only in everyday use of online communication, but also at work. Do not simply forward information that has been sent to you without first obtaining permission from the original sender. When sending private emails to multiple recipients, use BCC (blind carbon copy) instead of CC (carbon copy). Many people do not like their names and email addresses being passed on to people they do not know themselves.

         This rule on the internet also applies to uploading and sharing photos or videos that show other people. Before circulating such private files, be sure to check with the people concerned before doing so.

         Last but not least: Respect the privacy of others and do not sign up for newsletters, forums or the like with someone else's name or email address. </li><br><br>

         <li> <b><A name="7">Respect the time and bandwidth of others :</A></b>
         We live in a much faster world than our parents or grandparents are used to. Information can be sent to different people around the world in a matter of seconds â€“ and without much effort. Nevertheless, the bandwidth, that is to say the information capacity of wires and channels, is limited. It is similar with humans. Think of this limited receptivity of information when you send messages to your friends, colleagues or superiors.

         Do you get to the point quickly enough in your emails? Are your arguments formulated correctly and clearly recognizable? No one wants to waste time unnecessarily on an email whose core message is only at the end of the email. That consumes time and effort, and is simply annoying. Also, consider who really needs to be on the list of recipients. After all, respect for other people's time and bandwidth is also part of netiquette.</li><br><br>

         <li> <b><A name="8"> Forgive the mistakes of others :</A></b>
         Everyone who goes online to forums and networks was once a beginner. As in any other field, you can make mistakes as a beginner. In online communication, these can be a lack of etiquette or manners.

         Often these are spelling mistakes, superfluous questions or answers that are too long. With this in mind, it's important to forgive your counterparts' mistakes. If they are only minor mistakes, it is best not to react to them at all. In the event of a major error, for example a wrong quote, messages written only in capital letters or missing grammar and punctuation, then it is best to point it out to the person in a private message.

         A tip: Sarcasm in written form is not always recognizable to everyone on the internet. It is therefore better to remain objective. If you still want to express sarcasm among friends or close colleagues, use emojis such as smileys or GIFs. Carefully chosen, emojis can reinforce your message.</li> <br><br>

         <li><b> <A name="9">Netiquette Don't abuse your power :</A></b>
         On the internet, as in real life, some people have more power than others. Moderators in a forum, experts in companies or system administrators. If you have more power than others, you do not have the right to exploit this power.

         Don't spy on colleagues or chat participants just because you have the technical means to do so. For example, system administrators should never read private emails or find out about the salary structure in the company.</li><br><br>

         <li> <b><A name="10"> Help keep flame wars under control :</A></b>
         Flame wars are messages that contain aggressive personal criticism or attacks on a person. In group chats, heated discussions often degenerate into so-called flame wars. If you get into such a discussion, you should stay out of it. Always remember that you should treat others as you would like to be treated. Profanity is not part of netiquette.

         Also remember that insults and threats on the internet can have legal consequences for you. For this reason, do not be tempted to make such comments, even in heated discussions. Instead, demonstrate exemplary conduct on the internet.</li><br><br>

         <li><b><A name="11"> Know where you are in cyberspace :</A></b>
         Netiquette is interpreted differently in different places on the internet. For example, it is perfectly normal to spread gossip in a TV discussion group. However, if you do this in a serious discussion group, you will quickly make yourself unpopular. It is therefore important that you know where you are on the internet.

         This also means that if you are in a new area that is unfamiliar to you, you need to look around and learn the ropes. Get an idea of how other people in this area of cyberspace communicate with each other and adapt to them.</li><br><br>

         <li> <b> <A name="12">Hate speech and netiquette :</A></b>
         So-called hate speech on the internet is an increasing problem, especially in social media. It is often found in offensive comments under photos or posts. However, time and again there are coordinated actions by specific actors who join forces for the sole purpose of spreading hate comments. Not infrequently, social or religious fringe groups, foreigners or black people become victims of such actions.

         What can you do against hate speech? If you come across such statements on the internet, you should report them to the provider of the website. Often you will find the option to report a post directly underneath it on social media. The providers are legally obliged to delete content which is evidently illegal within 24 hours.

         In addition, you can actively approach the spreaders of hate speech and try to invalidate their statements and subsequently educate theperpetrators. It is advisable to ask for the alleged "facts" and take a clear position against hate. Steer the discussion in a more positive direction. However, under no circumstances should you react with hate or insults. You could also be held accountable for this.</li><br><br>
         
         <li> <b><A name="13"> Children on the internet Do not give out personal information :</A></b>
         In these times of social media, identity theft and social engineering, keeping personal information secret is essential! Under no circumstances should your child share passwords or personal information such as their name, address or telephone number online. The name of the school or clubs should also be kept secret.</li><br><br>

         <li><b> <A name="14">Use a neutral nickname :</A></b>
         Make sure that your child uses a neutral nickname in chat rooms. This should under no circumstances reveal your child's identity. In addition, a neutral nickname ensures that other people do not feel insulted or ridiculed.</li><br><br>

         <li> <b><A name="15"> Netiquette and bots/troll posts :</A></b>
         So-called bots are computer programs that usually automatically follow up on a task without requiring any interaction with humans. In social media channels, bots often post comments or even their own posts.

         They often spam in forums or in the comments under posts. This is annoying and time-consuming, as these responses have to be identified and removed. Bots are therefore not part of netiquette and should be avoided if at all possible.</li><br><br>

         <li> <b><A name="16"> Rules for children on the internet Do not trust chat participants :</A></b>
         Your child should always approach strangers with a healthy skepticism. You never know who is really hiding behind the funny profile name and picture. For example, your child should never meet a stranger just because they got along well in a chat conversation. It could be an adult with bad intentions.

         Similarly, you should explain to your child that they should not add strangers as friends on social media such as Facebook or Instagram. Your child should also not simply open emails and other messages and download attachments. In doing so, your child could accidentally download a Trojan or other malware.</li><br><br>

         <li><b><A name="17"> Fairness first Do not exclude anyone :</A></b>
         If your child is communicating in a private group, they should refrain from making insider jokes that not everyone in the group will understand. It is better to send a private message to this person. Other chat participants should not feel excluded. Netiquette includes values such as tolerance, respect and helpfulness. This also means that only the language used by everyone should be used.

         In a school group chat, your child should always make sure that all chat members are on the same level, for example during a review or presentation. When your child is explaining a topic that may not be clear to everyone, it is a good idea to answer questions about the topic.</li><br><br>

         <li><b> <A name="18">Netiquette for children Keep it short and clear
         Posts, answers and even questions should be kept as short and clear as possible. No one wants to read an unnecessary amount of text that does not contribute to answering the issue :</A></b>

         Cumbersome language and repetitions only clog up chats and forums; in addition, spelling mistakes can make it more difficult to read and understand what is being said. Forwarding chain letters also has no place in respectful online communication.</li><br><br>
         
            <li> <b><A name="19"> Trust your child :</A></b>
         Last but not least, the most important rule for children's use of the internet Trust your child. After all, you cannot permanently look over their shoulder, whether your child is learning via computer, smartphone or tablet. Your child learns best through their own experiences. Trust in your offspring's abilities, and refrain from constantly monitoring their internet activities. It is usually enough to know that your child can ask you for help if the worst happens.</li><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
