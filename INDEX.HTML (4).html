                <li><b> Hacking: </b> It is relatively easy for hackers to steal information and fraudsters to buy that information in the online black market</li><br>
                
                <li><b> Legal Loophole: </b> The law has been unable to keep up with online crimes. It is relatively difficult to track, identify, and prove the crime and the identity of the criminal.</li><br><br><br>

        </ul> 
               <li>
               Ways to Prevent E-commerce Fraud<br><br>

        <ul>
               <li><b>Shop Securely:</b>: Always use secured Internet connection and not a public Wi-Fi while purchasing something.</li><br>

               <li><b>Check the Grammar :</b>Look for grammatical errors because phishing websites often have grammatical errors in their text.</li> <br>

            <Li><A name="2">Privacy</A></Li> <br><br>
            <P>Privacy is defined as the right to control what happens with your personal information. It is defined as theindividuals, groups, or institutions to determine when, how, and to what extent information pertaining to them could be communicated to others. claim ofE-commerce can particularly affect the privacy rights and personal data of a person. You expose a lot of personal and financial information while making online transactions. The companies which market their products may exploit this information.Ethically, e-commerce sites should clearly state their privacy policy declaring how it uses and shares the gathered customer data or whether a customer can choose to keep his information private. However, like many other policies, the privacy policy is also buried in a long and fine printed legal document that customers rarely read, thus putting their information at risk to be distributed, sold, and misused.</P><br><br>
            To Safeguard Your Privacy <br> <br>
            The critical issue in maintaining data privacy is to share data while protecting personal information. Successful security solutions require a convergence of three components, i.e., Technology, People, and Processes.
            <br><br>
            The following ways can help you limit your data exposure online:
        <ol type="a">
            <Li><b>People</b></Li><br>
            Do not share your sensitive financial information like credit card numbers, personal verification details, OTP, etc., with anyone, especially on the phone.<br><br>
            <li><b>Processes</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Check the privacy policies of online merchants before signing up or making financial transactions online.</li><br>
                <li>Select the privacy clauses that restrict online retailers to share your personal information with other businesses.</li><br>
                <li>Read the reviews of the online customers of the site before making any purchases.</li><br><br>
            </ul> 
                <li>Technology</li><br>,<br>
            <ul>
               <li>Always set strong Password: The rule for setting passwords is that if they are easy to remember, then they are easy to crack. So, select a password which is difficult to trace, but which you can remember. Always use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters to set your password. Check if the website URL has https: and a padlock icon next to it, indicating that it is a secure website, before entering payment details into any site.</li><br>
               <li>Update the operating system and regularly install safety patches to safeguard your computing devices from malicious software, illegal access to bank account numbers and credit card details.</li><br>
               <Li>Never use open connections for communication. These are notoriously unsecured, and criminals can easily penetrate through these connections and monitor your financial activities. Use secure wi-fi or mobile data connections for making any online transactions.</Li><br><br>
            
            </ul>
        </ol>
            <li><A name="3" >Cyber Theft</A></li> <br>
            Cyber theft is the stealing of confidential, personal, and financial information, such as passwords, bank details, credit card details, etc., from a computer or a mobile phone, and misusing it to harm the user. When you access the Internet, you visit and the social networking websites that y you are a part of. Though this information and details are password protected, yet these are vulnerable to be stolen and misused by thieves on the Internet.<br><br>
            <li><A name="4" >Identity Theft</A></li><br>
             When someone else uses your online identity to create fraudulent messages or commit crimes, it is known as Identity theft. In other words, Identity theft is any kind of deception, scam, or crime that results in the loss of personal data such as, usernames, passwords, banking information, credit card numbers, Aadhar ID or Unique Identity Number (UID), which is then used without your permission to commit fraud and other crimes. In today's world, the biggest challenge for every Internet user is to safeguard his or her identity, which is constantly under threat from cyber thieves, hackers, and keyloggers.
