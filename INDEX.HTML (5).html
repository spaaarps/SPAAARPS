       <font size=4 color="black" face ="Elephant">Secure data   is imperative to privacy and protection from cyber and identity theft. This step ensures that the users' data travels through a secure environment that is resistant to penetration and hacking .<br><br>
           Following techniques may be applied to ensure secure transmission of data via the Internet:

    <ol type ="1">
        <Li><b><A name="1">Authentication And Authorisation:</A></b>
        Authentication is the basis of access control mechanism which is essential in securing data. When an individual introduces herself/himself to the security system, then her/his identity has to be verified. This is called authentication.A username and a password are the most common forms of identification and authentication respectively. However, in present times, only this information is not adequate. Authorisation is also required to access network. The administrative policies determine what information and computing services can be accessed by whom and under what conditions.</Li> <br><br>
         
        <li><b><A name="2">Intrusion Detection System:</A> </b>Detection System (IDS) checks all network movement and identifies doubtful patterns that may indicate a network or system attack from someone attempting to break into a system, for example, a Firewall.</li><br><br>
        
        <li><b><A name="3">Cryptography/Encryption:</A> </b>Any confidential data needs to be transferred over a secured channel. It needs to be encrypted or coded before being transmitted. Encryption is the process of transforming data into an unreadable code. The most common e-mail encryption is called PKI. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) is required for encryption and cybersecurity. It protects communications between the server and the users. It works by using two different cryptographic keys - a public key and a private key. The software applications, such as GnuPG or PGP can be used to encrypt data files and e-mails.</li><br><br>
        
        <li><b><A name="4">Https Protocols : </A></b>This encrypts the information or data using Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate or formerly, predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate. The certificate creates an encrypted connection between the server and the browser to ensure secured transfer of information from the server to the browser. This step protects users' information from being hacked or stolen by criminals .</li><br><br>
        
        <li><b><A name="5">Password And Pin Numbers :</A></b>Never share your password and PIN number with unauthorised personnel, underany circumstances.</li><br><br>
        
        <li><b><A name="6">Antivirus :</A></b>Antivirus software are computer programs which identify, prevent, and remove viruses from computer. Keep updating your computer with the latest versions of antivirus programs to detect new viruses.
Some of the popular antivirus programs are McAfee, AVG, Quick Heal, Norton, and Microsoft Security Essentials.</li><br><br><br><br><br>
